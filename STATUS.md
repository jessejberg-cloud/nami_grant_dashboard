# Where the NAMI Dashboard Suite stands

*The one place that says where we are. Update it whenever a stage moves, a decision is made, or something goes live. Last updated 2026-10-05.*

## Right now

**Stage 1 of 5: talking it through with Emily (the Executive Director), this week.** Everything is built, live and documented. Jesse sent Emily an informal overview on 2026-10-05 with the landing page, the plan and the handbook, and four options to think about. Nothing has gone to staff yet. The next move is the conversation; then the answers come back here and the documents are updated to match.

## The stages

**Stage 0: build and prepare. Done 2026-10-05.**
- [x] Grant Dashboard simplified (simple-v2), reviewed, and live: ChatGPT Site version 5, running the Dashboard files of `9b5ab68`, records kept
- [x] Grant Radar 2.1.1, on the landing page with no sign-in
- [x] Volunteers & Events 2.2, built and tested, held for phase two
- [x] Landing page live: https://jessejberg-cloud.github.io/nami_grant_dashboard
- [x] The handbook (plan, implementation, quick starts, manuals, emails), in PDF and Word, on the landing page
- [x] The plan on one page: https://jessejberg-cloud.github.io/nami_grant_dashboard/project-map.html
- [x] Name and credentials on the documents: Jesse Jonesberg, MSW, LCSW, CPS, www.intrinsicchange.com

**Stage 1: talk it through with Emily. This week.**
- [x] Informal overview emailed to Emily, 2026-10-05 (the text is at the end of this file)
- [ ] Conversation with Emily. Settle the four options:
  1. Who tests the grant programs: Emily, or whoever handles grants day to day?
  2. When week 1 starts: next week, or after Emily has tried the practice grants herself?
  3. How the program emails go out: Emily forwards them, or Jesse sends them with Emily copied?
  4. No rush: who at NAMI could be the second person with access in phase two?
- [ ] Bring the answers back to Claude (see "After the conversation" below)
- [ ] Print the handbook: one each for Jesse, Emily, the grants person and the office
- [ ] Optional: create a feedback email address, so the landing page's feedback button can be switched on

**Stage 2: phase one, testing the grant programs. About four weeks.**
- [ ] Week 1: the Grant Dashboard email (handbook appendix, email 2) reaches the grants person
- [ ] Week 1: a 20-minute walkthrough on practice grants (agenda in the handbook, chapter 2)
- [ ] Week 2: Grant Radar email (email 3), any time from here
- [ ] End of week 2: first check-in, three questions
- [ ] Week 3: real grants, if the grants person is comfortable, with a weekly backup
- [ ] End of week 4: second check-in; Emily confirms the internal person

**Stage 3: the decision, after week 4.** Has the Dashboard tracked one real grant to a report, and has Radar sent one good lead on? Yes means stage 4. Not yet means more testing with fixes, and asking again.

**Stage 4: phase two, NAMI's own home.** NAMI creates a GitHub organization and a Cloudflare account with two owners; Jesse moves everything there behind one sign-in by NAMI email; Volunteers & Events starts with the volunteer coordinator; fresh links and emails go out. Steps in the handbook, chapter 2.

## After the conversation with Emily

Tell Claude the four answers, plus a start date. Claude then:
- puts the owner's name on the landing page and in the emails (the documents say "the grants person" until then);
- changes the plan and the emails if Jesse, not Emily, sends the program emails;
- fills in the week dates in this file;
- rebuilds the handbook, so the printed copy matches.

## Decisions made, with dates

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-10-05 | The suite is called NAMI Dashboard Suite |
| 2026-10-05 | Grants first: the Grant Dashboard and Grant Radar are phase one; Volunteers & Events starts in phase two, behind NAMI's own sign-in |
| 2026-10-05 | The Dashboard runs on practice grants for weeks 1 and 2, real grants from week 3 with a weekly backup |
| 2026-10-05 | The landing page opens the no-sign-in copy of Grant Radar; its Claude page is kept private, as a spare |
| 2026-10-05 | Grant Radar says "Apply by", not "Deadline" |
| 2026-10-05 | NAMI has a donor system, so Volunteers & Events records money only when it is for an event |
| 2026-10-05 | Owners are named by role until names are known; the phase-two person is proposed as a role, confirmed by week 4 |
| 2026-10-05 | Walkthroughs are 20 minutes, by phone, screen share or in person, the owner's choice |
| 2026-10-05 | Check-ins by email at weeks 2 and 4, three questions, "haven't looked yet" accepted |
| 2026-10-05 | One handbook for everyone, leadership first, gaps included, PDF and Word |
| 2026-10-05 | Phase two's home is a NAMI-owned GitHub organization and Cloudflare account, free at this size |
| 2026-10-05 | Intrinsic Change (Jesse's practice tools) lives only in its own repository, never here |
| *pending* | Who sends the program emails (the documents currently say Emily forwards them) |

## Where everything is

| What | Where | How it is updated |

| Volunteers & Events | https://claude.ai/artifact/EDapVYL3SAdAPKV7duNK1H (private, nobody invited; phase two) | Republished from a Claude session |

## Open items

`GAPS.md` has the full list with owners. The ones that matter next: the conversation with Emily, the feedback address, and naming the phase-two person by week 4.
